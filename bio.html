                <h1>FIRST & FOREMOST... THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Keenan Tate Normington <strong>(b. 2002)</strong>. I am a fine art photographer based in
                    Wisconsin.
                </p>
                <p>I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (Peck School of the Arts) pursuing a Bachelor
                    of Fine Arts in Photography & Imaging. I will be graduating in Fall 2025.</p>
                <p>In the realm of photography, my interests span across various genres including portraiture,
                    landscape, street photography, and the use of alternative materials/processes. I utilize both film
                    and digital processes, taking special interest in the use of black and white imagery.
                </p>
                <p>Within my work, I explore the landscapes and people that make up my world. My goal is to capture the
                    beauty of our world, and the connections that bind us to one another. </p>
                <p>My current focus is on a long term project and in progress photo book titled <a
                        href="books/midwest"><em>Midwest</em></a>. Within this work, I explore the landscapes of the
                    American Midwest. Inspired by the people, culture, and rural areas of the Midwest, my goal is to
                    capture the essence of a region I’ve called home throughout my entire life. My lifelong connection
                    to the Midwest imbues this project with a sense of intimacy and authenticity. Through this work I
                    hope to share not only images of the Midwest’s beauty and character, but a profound connection to a
                    place I proudly call home. </p>
