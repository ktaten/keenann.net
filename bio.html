                <h1>FIRST & FOREMOST... THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Keenan Tate Normington <strong>(b. 2002)</strong>. I am a photographer currently based in
                    Milwaukee, WI. My
                    roots are in Wisconsin, which is where I’ve spent my entire life thus far.</p>

                <p>
                    I am a senior studying photography/imaging at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (Peck School of
                    the
                    Arts).

                </p>

                <p>In the realm of photography, my interests span across various genres including portraiture,
                    landscape, & street photography. I utilize both digital and film processes. Taking special interest
                    in the use of black and white imagery.</p>

                <p>My work explores the landscapes and people that make up my world. My goal is to capture the beauty of
                    our world and the connections that bind us, both to our environment and to one another.</p>
                <p></p>
